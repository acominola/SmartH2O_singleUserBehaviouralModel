# SmartH2O_singleUserBehaviouralModel
Code repository for the code developed in the SmartH2O project (http://www.smarth2o-fp7.eu/) for single-user behavioural modelling from samrt-metered data:

- directory "UserModelling" contains Matlab scripts used to run SmartH2O single-user behaviour models as described in deliverable D3.4 ("Final user behavior models and ABM platform") of the SmartH2O project;

- directory "End-use disaggregation" contains Python scripts to run HSID algorithm, published as: "Cominola, A., Giuliani, M., Piga, D., Castelletti, A., & Rizzoli, A. E. (2017). A Hybrid Signature-based Iterative Disaggregation algorithm for Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring. Applied Energy, 185, 331-344.". If you use this code, you must cite this journal paper.
